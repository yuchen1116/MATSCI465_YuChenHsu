How virtual detectors allow post-acquisition imaging?

Virtual detectors enable post-acquisition imaging because 4DSTEM records the full 2D diffraction pattern at every scan pixel.
This results in a rich 4D dataset that preserves the angular distribution of all scattered electrons.
Post-acquisition imaging is achieved by defining virtual masks on the diffraction pattern in software.
By mathematically integrating the intensities within these masks, we can synthesize images with arbitrary collection angles (e.g., bright field or annular dark field).
This effectively allows us to replay experiments after the sample has left the microscope and optimize detector geometry for specific contrast mechanisms (e.g., Z-contrast or diffraction contrast).
